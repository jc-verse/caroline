# Caroline language

## File format

- We are pretty extension-agnostic, but we recommend you choose one of: `.crln`, `.carrie`, or `.caroline`
- UTF-8, LF, pleaseâ€”we don't guarantee that your code can be parsed correctly with other encodings / format at this early stage, and it's very likely we will force you to enforce this style. BOM will be taken care of
